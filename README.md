# Code Refactor Starter Code

After refactoring code the first time I ran into an issue with getting the challenge to open via Github pages. Only the README file would display. I removed unnecessary nested files to bring index.html and assets to the same location as README. this caused new issues so I deleted the remote repo and recreated it but this also removed record of previous commits and comments.

first commit added comments to different sections of CSS.
second commit reduced redundant code.
